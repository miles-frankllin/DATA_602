    "# Abstract\n",
    "The goal of this project was to demonstrate a linear or logistic regression on a given dataset. One of the initial challenges of this project was understanding what qualities to look for in a dataset for this task. While prioritizing continuous data over categorical data helped, the most important quality was how well I could interpret or understand the results, regardless of how clean the model fit to the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by the work of [Davide Chicco & Giuseppe Jurman](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5#Sec2), the goal of this project was to see how well a basic logistic regression would serve as a prediction model for the death of a patient with a heart condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was able to account for 81% of the variance in the data, which adds confidence the results found in the reference paper. In that study, they used neural networks in their final model, which is a much more flexible model than linear regression. Moving forward, it would be interesting to see how a larger data set, paired with a more model would improve the accuracy of the predictions."

Unfortunately, I have not found a way to extract the built in feature selection from the sklearn library, although moving forward I would like to compare the listing with the features Davide Chicco & Giuseppe Jurman concluded were the strongest indicators.
