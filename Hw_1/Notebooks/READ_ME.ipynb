    "The goal of this project was to impliment a Linear Regression on a dataset of my choice. I chose to regress alcohol density onto percent alchol content from a pair of data sets from UCIML. While exploring the data, I became interested in how the rated quality effectd this measurement, and how the color of while effect the results. This exploration was not published in the [Technical Notebook](), altough the exploratory graphs can be found in [Additional Notebook](). "
