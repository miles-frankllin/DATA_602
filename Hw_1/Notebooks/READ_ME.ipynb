    "# Goal and Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to implement a Linear Regression on a select dataset. I chose to run a multiple logistic regression on the [Heart Failure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) data set with the goal of answering: how strong of a prediction model can be built using these few features, and among this list, which feature is the strongest single predictor of death for patients dealing with a heart condition."

    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is natural to want to leverage Machine Learning techniques in the world of health and medicine. In doing so, we can aim to maximize what we can learn from each patient, and better prepare for cases to come. In this particular study, we aim to better understand patients with heart conditions, since it is globally and nationally the leading cause death. "

    "# Background\n",
    "This data was provided from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data), and was based on real patient data gathered in 2015. The patients studied had varying degrees of heart failure, were ... Using a variety of Machine Learning techniques, they concluded that you could reliably predict survival rates studying serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone."
